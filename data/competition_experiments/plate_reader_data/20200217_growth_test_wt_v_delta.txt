# Person: Suzy and Molly
# Description :
# Grew up Gore's wildtype and lac operon deletion strain overnight in LB (no antibiotic). Diluted
# back to OD 0.0001 and grew separately in Gore's 0.05% glycerol, 0.2% lactose M9 media,
# or a combination of both. Monitored OD on a plate reader for ~24 hours to analyze growth
# curves.
# Comments :
# Water added to well D8 instead of D9, so sample was added o well D9 instead of D8.
